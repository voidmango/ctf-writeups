Whoops... I accidentally overwrote the magicNumber & achVendID in this font file. Can you help me retrieve them?

### solve

* Parts of the flag are split into the magicNumber and achVendID within the file.
	Extracting the bytes in the corresponding locations within the tables will get you the flag.

Flag:
```
shctf{th3r3_1s_always_s0me_h0p3_4r0und}
```
